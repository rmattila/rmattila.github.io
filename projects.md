While there exists reading material for the [shorthand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shorthand) system devised by [Hugh L. Callendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Longbourne_Callendar), known as [Orthic shorthand](https://orthic.shorthand.fun/), much of it is quite dated. This project aims to bring a fresh perspective to Orthic shorthand practice by allowing users to transcribe and practice with more contemporary and personally interesting materials. Whether it's the latest news articles, modern literature, or even daily correspondence, this tool opens up new avenues for both learning and enjoying this efficient shorthand system.

</p>

`arXamination` is a tool designed to aid in the quick review of academic papers. It uses a [large language model (LLM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) to provide insights into research papers, helping to assess their relevance and quality efficiently.

Originally developed for arXiv papers, `arXamination` now supports papers from any URL or local PDF files, broadening its usability -- this enables users to analyze a wider range of academic documents easily.

**Key aspects:**

- Analyzes research papers from various sources.
- Utilizes LLMs like [GPT4All](https://gpt4all.io/index.html) or [OpenAI's GPT models](https://openai.com/product).
- Offers a command-line interface for ease of use.

`arXamination` is suitable for anyone needing a quick yet thorough understanding of a research paper.

Just because two points are close on a map does not mean that they are "close in time" --
the time to travel from one location to another depends on, e.g., the location of roads
and public transport. In this post, we compute and plot
[isochrones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isochrone_map) in Stockholm when traveling
using public transport.

## MDP-Explore 

[![MDP-Explore Screenshot](https://rmattila.github.io/img/mdp-explore2.png)](https://github.com/rmattila/MDP-Explore)


This is a tool for graphically illustrating the (possibly time-dependent)
Markov chain underlying a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The figure can be
exported as a pdf-file.
