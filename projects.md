`arXamination` is a tool designed to aid in the quick review of academic papers. It uses a [large language model (LLM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) to provide insights into research papers, helping to assess their relevance and quality efficiently.

Originally developed for arXiv papers, `arXamination` now supports papers from any URL or local PDF files, broadening its usability -- this enables users to analyze a wider range of academic documents easily.

**Key aspects:**

- Analyzes research papers from various sources.
- Utilizes LLMs like [GPT4All](https://gpt4all.io/index.html) or [OpenAI's GPT models](https://openai.com/product).
- Offers a command-line interface for ease of use.

`arXamination` is suitable for anyone needing a quick yet thorough understanding of a research paper.

Just because two points are close on a map does not mean that they are "close in time" --
the time to travel from one location to another depends on, e.g., the location of roads
and public transport. In this post, we compute and plot
[isochrones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isochrone_map) in Stockholm when traveling
using public transport.

This is a tool for graphically illustrating the (possibly time-dependent)
Markov chain underlying a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The figure can be
exported as a pdf-file.
