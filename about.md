title: About
---

I graduated from KTH's Engineering Physics programme (MSc in Systems, Control
and Robotics) in 2015 and began as a PhD student at the [Department of
Automatic
Control](https://www.kth.se/en/ees/omskolan/organisation/avdelningar/ac) the
same year under the supervision of Prof. Bo Wahlberg and co-supervision of
Assoc. Prof. Cristian R. Rojas. I have been a visiting research student at the
Zhejiang University, Caltech and the University of British Colombia (UBC). My
research interests are in the identification and control of hidden Markov
models and applications related to social networks.
