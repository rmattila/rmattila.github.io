## Bio

I graduated from KTH's Engineering Physics programme (MSc in Systems, Control
and Robotics) in 2015 and began as a PhD student at the [Department of
Automatic
Control](https://www.kth.se/en/ees/omskolan/organisation/avdelningar/ac) the
same year under the supervision of Prof. <a href="http://people.kth.se/~bo/">Bo
Wahlberg</a> and co-supervision of Assoc. Prof. <a
href="https://people.kth.se/~crro/">Cristian R. Rojas</a>. I have been
a visiting research student at the Zhejiang University, Caltech and the
University of British Colombia (UBC). My research interests are in the
identification and control of hidden Markov models and applications related to
social networks and medicine.
