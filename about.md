## Bio

I graduated from KTH's [Engineering
Physics](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/program/CTFYS/20102/mal?l=en) programme in 2015
with an MSc in [Systems, Control and
Robotics](https://www.kth.se/en/studies/master/systems-control-robotics/description-1.8733)
and began as a PhD student at the [Department of Automatic
Control](https://www.kth.se/en/ees/omskolan/organisation/avdelningar/ac) the same year
under the supervision of Prof. [Bo Wahlberg](http://people.kth.se/~bo/) and co-supervision
of Assoc. Prof. [Cristian R. Rojas](https://people.kth.se/~crro/). I have been a visiting
researcher at the [California Institute of Technology (Caltech)](http://www.caltech.edu),
the [University of British Colombia (UBC)](https://www.ubc.ca) and [Cornell
Tech](https://tech.cornell.edu). My research interests are within inference and control of
stochastic dynamical systems (in particular of [hidden Markov
models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model)), as well as, real-world
applications of machine learning and optimization -- such as in medicine.
