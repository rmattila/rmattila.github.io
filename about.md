## Bio

I graduated from KTH's [Engineering
Physics](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/program/CTFYS/20102/mal?l=en) programme in 2015
with an MSc in [Systems, Control and
Robotics](https://www.kth.se/en/studies/master/systems-control-robotics/description-1.8733)
and began as a PhD student at the [Division of Decision and Control
Systems](https://www.kth.se/dcs/) the same year under the supervision of Prof. [Bo
Wahlberg](http://people.kth.se/~bo/) and co-supervision of Prof. [Cristian R.
Rojas](https://people.kth.se/~crro/). I have been a visiting researcher at the [California
Institute of Technology (Caltech)](http://www.caltech.edu), the [University of British
Colombia (UBC)](https://www.ubc.ca) and [Cornell Tech](https://tech.cornell.edu). My
research interests are within inference and control of stochastic dynamical systems (in
particular of [hidden Markov models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model)),
as well as real-world applications of machine learning and optimization (e.g., in medicine
and health-care). In June 2020, I was awarded my PhD degree. I am currently employed as
a data scientist at [SEB Analytics](https://seb.se/).
