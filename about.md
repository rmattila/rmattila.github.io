## Bio

I graduated from KTH's Engineering Physics programme in 2015 with an MSc in *Systems,
Control and Robotics* and began as a PhD student at the [Department of Automatic
Control](https://www.kth.se/en/ees/omskolan/organisation/avdelningar/ac) the same year
under the supervision of Prof. [Bo Wahlberg](http://people.kth.se/~bo/) and co-supervision
of Assoc. Prof. [Cristian R. Rojas](https://people.kth.se/~crro/). I have been a visiting
research student at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) and the University of
British Colombia (UBC). My research interests are in the identification and control of
hidden Markov models and applications related to social networks and medicine.
