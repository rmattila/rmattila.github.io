### EL1000 - Basic Control with Bo Wahlberg

I will upload my exercise notes (in Swedish) here as the course proceeds.
These are heavily based on earlier notes by [HÃ¥kan
Terelius](http://people.kth.se/~hakante/teaching.html), [Mariette
Annergren](https://people.kth.se/~marann/el1000.html), [Martin
Andreasson](https://people.kth.se/~mandreas/teaching.html) och Niclas Blomberg.

* [Exercise 1](/public/el1000_ovn1.pdf)
* [Exercise 2](/public/el1000_ovn2.pdf) <br/>
**Note**: Exercises 3.1, 3.2bc and 3.3bc refer to the old compendium (2011
version). These have been slightly modified and merged into one exercise (3.1)
in the new compendium (2013 version).
