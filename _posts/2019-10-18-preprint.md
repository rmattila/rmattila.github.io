A preprint of our latest work [What Did Your Adversary Believe? Optimal Filtering and
Smoothing in Counter-Adversarial Autonomous Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.07332.pdf)
is now available on arXiv. 

An adversary deploys an autonomous filtering and control system that:

1. measures our current state [via a noisy
   sensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model), 
2. computes a [posterior
   estimate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_Bayesian_estimation) (belief) and
3. [takes an
   action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_observable_Markov_decision_process) that we can observe.

 Based on such observed actions and our knowledge of our state sequence, we aim to
estimate the adversary’s past and current beliefs – this forms a foundation for
predicting, and counteracting against, future actions.

Have a look, and feel free to send me any comments you may have by email!
