My colleague [Inês Lourenço](https://www.kth.se/profile/ineslo) has just published
a pre-print of her latest work: *[Cooperative System Identification via Correctional
Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.05161.pdf)*. It has been developed in collaboration
with me, [Cristian Rojas](https://people.kth.se/~crro/index.html) and [Bo
Wahlberg](https://www.kth.se/profile/bo).

In this work, we consider a scenario where a teacher knows a correct model of a system and
aims to assist a student who is trying to estimate it. However, the teacher cannot
directly transfer its model to the student -- for example, the teacher's knowledge might
be abstract (e.g., what is your internal model of how to drive a car?). 

We propose *correctional learning* as an approach to this problem: in order to assist the
student, the teacher can intercept the observations collected from the system and modify
them so as to maximize the amount of information the student receives.


Have a look at the pre-print, and send [Inês](https://www.kth.se/profile/ineslo) or me any
comments you may have!
