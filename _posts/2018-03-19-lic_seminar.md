I presented, and successfully defended, my licentiate thesis **Hidden Markov models:
Identification, control and inverse
filtering** (available
[here](http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1186464/FULLTEXT01.pdf)) today.

I would like to thank [Prof. Eric
Moulines](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=_XE1LvQAAAAJ&hl=en) ("[...undeniably
one of the best international experts in Machine learning, Mathematical and Computational
statistics, as well as Non-Linear Time series analysis and Markov
Chains.](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en/content/new-professors-data-science-lx)") for
being the special reviewer of my thesis.

Our discussion was very constructive, and I received a lot of valuable feedback.
