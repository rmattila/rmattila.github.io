I'm happy to announce that our paper *[How to Protect Your Privacy?  A Framework for
Counter-Adversarial Decision Making](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.04119.pdf)* has been
accepted for presentation at [the 59th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control
(CDC'20)](https://cdc2020.ieeecss.org/).
 

My colleague [Inês Lourenço](https://www.kth.se/profile/ineslo) is first author of the
paper, which has been developed in collaboration with me, [Cristian
Rojas](https://people.kth.se/~crro/index.html) and [Bo
Wahlberg](https://www.kth.se/profile/bo). It is an extension of our [recent
works](/publications/) that investigate counter-adversarial signal processing.
