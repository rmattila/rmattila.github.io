My collaborator [Inês Lourenço](https://www.kth.se/profile/ineslo) has successfully
defended her licentiate thesis [Forward and Inverse Decision-Making in Adversarial,
Cooperative, and Biologically-Inspired Dynamical
Systems](http://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1555961/FULLTEXT01.pdf) with Assist.
Prof. [Karinne Ramírez-Amaro](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=m24umY4AAAAJ&hl=en)
acting as opponent -- congratulations, Inês!  

Have a look at her thesis for a very interesting read on the mechanisms that generate
certain behaviors (the *forward* problem), together with practical techniques for
estimating model characteristics of those mechanisms based on observed decisions (the
*inverse* problem).
