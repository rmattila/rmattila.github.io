My colleague [Inês Lourenço](https://www.kth.se/profile/ineslo) has just published
a pre-print of her latest work: *[How to Protect Your Privacy?  A Framework for
Counter-Adversarial Decision Making](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.04119.pdf)*.

It has been developed in collaboration with me, [Cristian
Rojas](https://people.kth.se/~crro/index.html) and [Bo
Wahlberg](https://www.kth.se/profile/bo). It is an extension of our [recent
works](/publications/) that investigate counter-adversarial signal processing. 

The central question asked in the paper is: 
How can a decision maker select an action that
1. ensures that its private belief is not exposed, 
2. while minimizing its cost?

Have a look, and send [Inês](https://www.kth.se/profile/ineslo) or me any
comments you may have!
