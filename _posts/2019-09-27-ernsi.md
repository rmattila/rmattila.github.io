This week, I attended the annual workshop of the [European Research Network on System
Identification (ERNSI)](https://ernsi2019.tue.nl/) in Maastricht, the Netherlands -- very
interesting presentations and discussions! Me and [Inês
Lourenço](https://www.kth.se/profile/ineslo) presented a poster related to our recent
[paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8693524) on estimating private beliefs from
observed decisions.
