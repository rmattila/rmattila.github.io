In exactly two weeks -- on the 23rd of November -- my collaborator [Inês
Lourenço](https://www.kth.se/profile/ineslo) will defend her PhD thesis
[Learning from Interactions: Forward and Inverse Decision-Making for Autonomous
Dynamical
Systems](http://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1808643/FULLTEXT01.pdf)!

In the thesis, she explores decision-making in autonomous agents, focusing on how they learn
and adapt through interactions with their environment and each other. The
research spans four key areas, including private belief modeling and
human-robot interactions, offering practical insights for developing smarter,
more responsive autonomous systems.
