This week, I attended the annual workshop of the [European Research Network on System
Identification](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/ernsi2018/) (ERNSI) that was held at [Pembroke
College](http://www.pem.cam.ac.uk/), Cambridge, U.K. There were many interesting talks and
discussions. I presented a poster on method of moment identification of hidden Markov
models.
