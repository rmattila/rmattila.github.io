I'm happy to announce that our paper [*What Did Your Adversary Believe? Optimal Filtering
and Smoothing in Counter-Adversarial Autonomous
Systems*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.07332.pdf) has been accepted for presentation in
a lecture session at the 45th [International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal
Processing (ICASSP)](https://2020.ieeeicassp.org/). This year, the conference will be held
4-8 May, in Barcelona, Spain.

The work has been developed together with [Inês
Lourenço](https://www.kth.se/profile/ineslo), [Vikram
Krishnamurthy](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=em7o4kwAAAAJ&hl=en), [Cristian
Rojas](https://people.kth.se/~crro/index.html) and [Bo
Wahlberg](https://www.kth.se/profile/bo).
