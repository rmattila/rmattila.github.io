I am happy to announce that our paper *Estimating Private Beliefs of Bayesian Agents Based
on Observed Decisions* has been accepted for publication in the [IEEE Control Systems
Letters (L-CSS)](http://ieee-cssletters.dei.unipd.it/index.php). The work has been
developed in collaboration with [Inês Lourenço](https://www.kth.se/profile/ineslo).

In this paper, we investigate how one can estimate how agents perceive the world based on
their decisions and actions. This is a natural continuation of our previous works on
inverse filtering
[[1](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7008-inverse-filtering-for-hidden-markov-models),
[2](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8619013)]. We believe that our results have
applications in, for example, [social
learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_learning_theory).
