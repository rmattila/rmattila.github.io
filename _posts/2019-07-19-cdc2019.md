I'm glad to announce that our L-CSS paper [*Estimating Private Beliefs of Bayesian Agents
Based on Observed Decisions*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8693524) has also been
accepted for presentation at the 58th [IEEE Conference on Decision and
Control (CDC)](https://cdc2019.ieeecss.org/). The conference will this year be held 11-13
December in Nice, France.

In the paper, we consider sequential stochastic decision problems in which, at each time
instant, an agent optimizes its [local utility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility) by
solving a [stochastic program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_programming) and,
subsequently, announces its decision to the world. Given this action, we study the problem
of estimating the agent's private belief -- that is, its posterior distribution over the
set of states of nature based on its private observations.

In other words: how can one estimate how agents perceive the world based on
their decisions and actions? This is a natural continuation of our previous works on
inverse filtering
