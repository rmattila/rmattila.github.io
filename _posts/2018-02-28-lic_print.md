My licentiate thesis (*Hidden Markov models: Identification, control and inverse
filtering*) is now written and has been printed. If you want a physical copy, pass by my
office and I will be glad to give you one. It is also available online
[here](http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1186464/FULLTEXT01.pdf).

If you have any comments, please feel free to contact me.
