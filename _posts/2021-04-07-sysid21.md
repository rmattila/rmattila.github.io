I'm happy to announce that our paper *[Cooperative System Identification via Correctional
Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.05161.pdf)* has been accepted for presentation at [the 19th IFAC Symposium
System Identification (SYSID'21)](https://www.sysid2021.org/), which will take place July

The paper is a joint work between [Inês Lourenço](https://www.kth.se/profile/ineslo), me,
[Cristian Rojas](https://people.kth.se/~crro/index.html) and [Bo
Wahlberg](https://www.kth.se/profile/bo). A brief summary is available
