This week, I'm attending the [35th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML
2018)](http://www.icml.cc) in Stockholm. 

If you are also attending, be sure to check out the paper [*Bayesian Model Selection for
Change Point Detection and Clustering*](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/mazhar18a.html),
which was written and will be presented by two of my collegues at the department: [Othmane
Mazhar](https://www.kth.se/profile/othmane) and [Cristian
Rojas](https://people.kth.se/~crro/index.html).
