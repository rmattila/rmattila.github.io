I visited [Vikram Krishnamurthy](https://tech.cornell.edu/people/vikram-krishnamurthy) at
the newly built campus of [Cornell Tech](https://tech.cornell.edu) on Roosevelt Island,
Manhattan, together with Bo Wahlberg. I gave a seminar on _Inverse filtering in
hidden Markov models_ -- a topic we have been working on lately.
