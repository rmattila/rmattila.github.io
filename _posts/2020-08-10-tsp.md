I am glad to announce that our paper [*Inverse Filtering for Hidden Markov Models with
Applications to Counter-Adversarial Autonomous
Systems*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.11809.pdf) (an updated version is
available in [Chapter 7 of my
thesis](https://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1428900/FULLTEXT01.pdf)) has been
accepted for publication in the [IEEE Transactions on Signal
Processing](https://signalprocessingsociety.org/publications-resources/ieee-transactions-signal-processing).

In this work, we formulate and propose solutions to the problem of inverse [dynamical
Bayesian inference
(filtering)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_Bayesian_estimation) for [hidden
Markov models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model). In other words, given
a sequence of [posteriors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_algorithm), we present
identifiability results together with a method to identify the filter's parameters,
comprising the transition matrix of the hidden process, the matrix of observation
likelihoods as well as the sequence of measured observations y<sub>1</sub>, ...,
y<sub>N</sub>.

As an application of our results, we demonstrate the design of a [counter-adversarial
autonomous system](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2963835): How can
we estimate the accuracy of an adversary's sensor, based on measurements of its actions?
We believe that this paper significantly advances the toolset available to practitioners
dealing with counter-adversarial systems. 


The work has been developed in collaboration with [Cristian
Rojas](https://people.kth.se/~crro/index.html), [Vikram
Krishnamurthy](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=em7o4kwAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Bo
Wahlberg](https://www.kth.se/profile/bo). We are very excited about this line of research
