This summer, I attended the [VUB-ELEC](http://vubirelec.be)'s [2017 Workshop on System
Identification](http://vubirelec.be/workshop_2017).

 The following courses were lectured:
*Frequency Response Function Measurements (Non-Parametric Tools)* by John Lataire, Yves
Rolain and Rik Pintelon; *Dynamic System
Identification (Parametric Tools)* by Rik Pintelon, Ivan Markovsky, Philippe Dreesen, John
Lataire, Maarten Schoukens and Koen Tiels; and *Control-Oriented System Identification* by
Simone Formentin.
