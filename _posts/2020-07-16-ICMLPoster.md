The [International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML'20)](https://icml.cc/) is almost
over. Due to the current extraordinary global situation, the conference was [fully
digital](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2020/VirtualICML) this year.

We presented our paper [*Fast and Consistent Learning of Hidden Markov Models by
Incorporating Non-Consecutive
Correlations*](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/3896-Paper.pdf)
during two virtual poster sessions. Thanks everyone that "stopped by" our poster -- the
discussions were very constructive!
