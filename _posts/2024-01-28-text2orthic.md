While there exists reading material for the [shorthand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shorthand) system devised by [Hugh L. Callendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Longbourne_Callendar), known as [Orthic shorthand](https://orthic.shorthand.fun/), much of it is quite dated. [My latest project](https://github.com/rmattila/text2orthic) aims to bring a fresh perspective to Orthic shorthand practice by allowing users to transcribe and practice with more contemporary and personally interesting materials. Whether it's the latest news articles, modern literature, or even daily correspondence, this tool opens up new avenues for both learning and enjoying this efficient shorthand system.
