Our latest article *[A Biologically-Inspired Computational Model of Time
Perception](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9570769)* has been accepted for
publication in the [IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental
Systems](https://cis.ieee.org/publications/t-cognitive-and-developmental-systems). TCDS
focuses on advances in the study of development and cognition in natural (humans, animals)
and artificial (robots, agents) systems. 


In this work, we study how humans and animals perceive the passage of time. Time
perception forms the basis for important cognitive skills such as decision-making,
planning, and communication. We propose a framework and model neural time perception as
a combination of two known timing sources: internal neuronal mechanisms and external
(environmental) stimuli, and design a decision-making framework to replicate them.
Overall, our work shows promising results when it comes to drawing conclusions regarding
some of the characteristics present in biological timing mechanisms.
