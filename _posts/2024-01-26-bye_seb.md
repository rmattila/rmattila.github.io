After three years at SEB, today I handed in my laptop, phone, and access card.
I'm very grateful for having had the opportunity to work with and learn from so
many talented individuals there. In particular, working with fantastic
colleagues in [Group Data
Analytics](https://sebgroup.com/career/who-are-we/career-at-seb/tech) and
[SEBx](https://sebx.io/) has been extremely rewarding.
