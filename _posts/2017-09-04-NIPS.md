I am very glad to be able to announce that out of the 3240 submissions that were made, our
paper *Inverse Filtering for Hidden Markov Models* is one of the 678 that were accepted
for presentation at the [31st Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems
(**NIPS**)](http://www.nips.cc). This year, the conference is held December 4-9 in the
Long Beach Convention Center, Long Beach, USA.

The paper is joint work between me, [Cristian Rojas](https://people.kth.se/~crro/),
[Vikram Krishnamurthy](https://tech.cornell.edu/people/vikram-krishnamurthy) and [Bo
Wahlberg](http://people.kth.se/~bo/). The paper introduces and provides initial solutions
to a new class of inference problems. Potential areas of applications include, e.g.,
machine learning, signal processing, fault detection, microeconomics and finance.
