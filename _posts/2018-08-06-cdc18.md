I'm glad to announce that our paper *Inverse Filtering for Linear Gaussian State-Space
Models* has been accepted for presentation at [the 57th IEEE Conference on Decision
and Control (CDC'18)](https://cdc2018.ieeecss.org/), that will be held 17-19 December in
Miami Beach, FL, USA. 

The paper extends the results in our 2017 NIPS paper ([''*Inverse Filtering for
Hidden Markov
Models*''](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7008-inverse-filtering-for-hidden-markov-models))
to [linear Gaussian state-space
models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter#Underlying_dynamical_system_model).
