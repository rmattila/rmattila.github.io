I attended this year's [ERNSI workshop](https://ernsi2017.sciencesconf.org) and presented
a poster related to our NIPS paper on *Inverse filtering for hidden Markov models*. The
*[European Research Network for System Identification](https://people.kth.se/~bo/ERNSI/)*
(ERNSI) workshop is a yearly workshop that was launched in 1992. The workshop was this
year held in Lyon, France.
