Starting end of this month, I will be teaching the course [EL2805 Reinforcement
Learning](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/EL2805?l=en) together with Prof.
[Alexandre Proutiere](https://people.kth.se/~alepro/) and
[Damianos Tranos](https://www.kth.se/profile/tranos).

The course provides an in-depth treatment of the modern theoretical tools used to devise
and analyse [RL algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning). It
includes an introduction to RL and to its classical algorithms such as
[Q-learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning), and
[SARSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State%E2%80%93action%E2%80%93reward%E2%80%93state%E2%80%93action),
but further presents the rationale behind the design of more recent algorithms, such as
those striking optimal trade-off between exploration and exploitation. The course also
covers algorithms used in recent RL success stories, e.g., [deep RL
algorithms](https://deepmind.com/blog/deep-reinforcement-learning/).
