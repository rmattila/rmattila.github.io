Our new work **An Optimal Gender-Specific Treatment Policy for
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms Constructed Using a Markov Decision Process Model** has been
accepted for presentation at the Society for Vascular Surgery's *2017 Vascular Annual
Meeting*, to be held in San Diego, California from May 31 to June 3, 2017.

The work jointly with Antti Siika and Joy Roy at Karolinska Institute. It is
a continuation of our previous article [A Markov Decision Process Model to Guide Treatment
of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02177).
