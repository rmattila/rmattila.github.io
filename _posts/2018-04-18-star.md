As a step in our continued collaboration with [abdominal aortic aneurysm
(AAA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_aortic_aneurysm) researchers at
[KI](http://ki.se), I attended the [Stockholm Aneurysm Research Group
(STAR)](https://ki.se/en/mmk/star-stockholm-aneurysm-research-group) meeting. It featured
interesting talks by, amongst others, [Prof. Christian
Gasser](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tAOL4nAAAAAJ&amp;hl=en) and [Joy
Roy](https://ki.se/en/people/joyroy), who presented and discussed current trends in AAA
research.
