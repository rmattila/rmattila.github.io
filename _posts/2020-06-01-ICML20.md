I'm very happy to announce that our paper *"Fast and Consistent Learning of Hidden Markov
Models by Incorporating Non-Consecutive Correlations"* has been accepted for this year's 
[International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML'20)](https://icml.cc/). 

This work has been developed in collaboration with [Cristian
Rojas](https://people.kth.se/~crro/index.html), [Eric
Moulines](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=_XE1LvQAAAAJ&hl=fr), [Vikram
Krishnamurthy](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=em7o4kwAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Bo
Wahlberg](https://www.kth.se/profile/bo). 

In the paper, we study how the parameters of an
[HMM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model) can be estimated from observed data in
fast and algorithmically attractive ways. The work could benefit practitioners working
with large-scale time-series datasets (e.g., bioscience, finance, social networks, ...).

A "preprint" of the paper is available in my [PhD thesis](https://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1428900/FULLTEXT01.pdf) (see Chapter 4) -- to be defended tomorrow.
