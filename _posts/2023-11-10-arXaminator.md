I'm happy to share my latest project, `arXamination`, a handy tool to assist in
the review of academic papers. Using [_large language models
(LLMs)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model), it helps in
quickly identifying key insights and gauging the relevance of research papers.
Initially tailored for arXiv pre-prints, `arXamination` now also processes
documents from any URL or local PDF, offering greater flexibility. Whether
you're skimming through research for a literature review or in-depth study,
`arXamination` is designed to make your reading process more efficient. Check out
how it can streamline your academic reading workflow.
