The [Department of Automatic
Control](https://www.kth.se/ac/department-of-automatic-control-1.788078) and Prof.
[Alexandre Proutiere](https://people.kth.se/~alepro/) (who I'm teaching [EL2805
Reinforcement Learning](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/EL2805?l=en) together with)
are currently featured in the [KTH
news](https://www.kth.se/en/eecs/nyheter/kth-topp-30-pa-varldens-storsta-ai-arena-1.861114):

*"Today marks the start of [Neural Information Processing Systems
(NeurIPS)](https://nips.cc/), the worldâ€™s largest and most prestigious conference in
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), an arena to which merely the best
are invited to present their research.*

*The Department of Automatic Control has published papers at NeurIPS consistently for six
years, an achievement that is unique in Sweden. KTH in general did well, setting a record
with five accepted papers. Three of those papers comes from the Department of Automatic
Control."*

Last year, our department had two papers:
[mine](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7008-inverse-filtering-for-hidden-markov-models) and
[Stefan Magureanu](https://people.kth.se/~magur/index.html)'s
[paper](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6773-minimal-exploration-in-structured-stochastic-bandits).
